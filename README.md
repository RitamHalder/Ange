Our Healthcare System is a groundbreaking platform designed to revolutionize patient care and diagnosis through advanced machine learning techniques. With a comprehensive approach encompassing multiple health 
conditions, this system integrates cutting-edge technologies to provide accurate and timely assessments.

At the heart of our system lies a sophisticated hybrid model, meticulously crafted to address various medical concerns. This model amalgamates three powerful machine learning algorithms, each tailored to 
tackle distinct health challenges.

1. Skin Cancer Detection: The first feature of our healthcare system is a robust skin cancer detection model. Leveraging the power of image processing techniques and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), 
this module can analyze dermoscopic images with exceptional precision. By scrutinizing the intricate details of skin lesions, it accurately identifies potential malignancies, enabling early intervention and 
treatment.
2. General Heart Attack Prediction: Our system also boasts a comprehensive heart attack prediction model, capable of evaluating the risk factors associated with cardiovascular diseases. 
Utilizing Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification, this module analyzes a range of input parameters to predict the likelihood of a heart attack. By assessing vital indicators such as blood pressure, 
cholesterol levels, and lifestyle factors, it empowers users with insights into their cardiovascular health, facilitating proactive measures for prevention and management.
3. Breast Cancer Prediction: Furthermore, our healthcare system incorporates a sophisticated breast cancer prediction model based on Random Forest classification. By examining a multitude of patient-specific 
factors and diagnostic features, this module delivers accurate assessments of breast cancer risk. Whether it's identifying suspicious abnormalities or reassuring patients with negative results, 
this tool plays a pivotal role in early detection and personalized healthcare planning.
